core/chunked_convert.py
-----------------------
VRAM-aware chunked voice conversion using the Kanade model.

On CUDA devices, the source waveform is split into overlapping chunks so that
peak activation memory stays within a configurable fraction of total VRAM
(default 50%).  On CPU the waveform is still chunked to respect the model's
RoPE sequence-length limit.

RoPE ceiling (why chunks must be small)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Kanade ``mel_decoder`` Transformer processes mel-spectrogram frames of the
source chunk.  Its RoPE positional embeddings are precomputed for
``_ROPE_MAX_FRAMES = 1024`` positions.  The mel frame count for a window of
``W`` samples is ``W // hop_length + 1``.  Keeping that ≤ 1024 requires:

    W  ≤  (1024 − 1) × hop_length  =  1023 × 256  =  261,888 samples  ≈ 10.9 s

Each chunk window includes a 0.5 s overlap on both sides for boundary
smoothing, so the *chunk* itself must be:

    chunk  ≤  261,888 − 2 × (0.5 s × sample_rate)  ≈  9.9 s

A 10 % safety margin is applied, giving ``_ROPE_SAFE_CHUNK_FACTOR ≈ 8.9 s``
worth of source audio per chunk.

Overlap / boundary handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each chunk includes a short overlap window on both sides.  After the
voice-conversion forward pass, the overlap frames are trimmed from the mel
output before the pieces are concatenated.  The final assembled mel is vocoded
in a single pass.
